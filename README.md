## Description

    This project waas built for all the coders who struggle to create cluid and professional readme.md files. Many young developers don't spend enough time developing excellent presentaions of their hard work. The generator will build a readme based off of the pre-built template but with custom user input.

        Deployed App - a deployed application url
